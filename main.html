    <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. It gives an estimate of the running time for an algorithm based on the size of the input. Time complexity is crucial for determining how efficient an algorithm is, particularly when processing large datasets.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm needs to run as a function of the size of the input. It is important for understanding the memory requirements of an algorithm. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of <em>O(n)</em> requires memory that grows linearly with the input size.</p>
